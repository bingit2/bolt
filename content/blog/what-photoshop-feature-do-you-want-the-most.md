title: "What Photoshop feature do you want the most?"
date: 2024-11-10

*I'm not the OP, this was posted by **Katie** on *03/18/2024* to XYZ Discord server.* 

If you could wave a magic wand and have the feature you most want or need show up in Photoshop, what would you create?

> That is a tough question as Photoshop is one of the most amazing programs I&rsquo;ve ever used and I love that. It&rsquo;s becoming more vector-based as well as Pixel -based. I don&rsquo;t use illustrator nearly as much now as I used to because I can do it all in Photoshop. I really like the AI capabilities that are being added, also along with the neural filters.

> I'm an artist and an engineer so I see problems/solutions through two different lenses. Also, I have more than 20,000 photos. I would like to be able to train my own model for GenFill using my own data. I can already do this using various other tools. However, it would be cool if Adobe made this a possibility. Particularly for people who have image data but don't have the technical expertise to do this themselves via Python, CUDA, etc. If custom-made GenFill models ended up being pretty cool, people could share them with others or license them for use in the Adobe Marketplace. Furthermore, if a person has the appropriate GPU hardware, they could generate pixels on their own PCs (instead of having to send image requests to a cloud service to be rendered and sent back). This could alleviate a lot of issues for Adobe regarding keyword and content moderation, pixel processing and storage, the credits system, and more. It's going to happen anyways (and is already happening to a large extent); Adobe and Photoshop should get a jump on it now.

> P.S. - I'm not saying clip studio paint is better (because it's not), but it does have some lovely features that photoshop is missing. - I wish it had brushes which could be made from full colour images, I'd love for example to import a perhaps 10 top-down 'tree' images, and then when I use them as some kind of brush, it would randomly just 'paint in' a tree. - Using the brush settings like angle jitter, size variance etc.

Photoshop isn't very good with  text generally, it's also not is main selling point, as a raster program, but making it close to what Illustrator does (I won't ask for being close to InDesign here &#128578; )  would be great!

> I'm surprised that every comment isn't a perfect mask maker/background remover. Although the remove background is so good as is imagine popping in a tree with many thin trees and removing the background inbetween everything with 1 button press. Or masking a cat with hair edges and whiskers somehow perfectly included. Or possibly more realistically, a feature for when you go to select and mask, have it automatically outline the edges with whatever brush you desire the same manner a stroke would outline the masked item. As I frequently spend time just outlining with those select mask tools to make a better mask.
