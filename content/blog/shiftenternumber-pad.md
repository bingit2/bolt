Is there a reason why Photoshop doesn't create a new line when I press Shift+Enter (the number pad Enter key)? It seems like a handy feature to have, especially since it's not assigned to anything. In earlier versions of photoshop(2019), going into the text box mode and pressing those keys actually opened the 3D workspace but it doesn't seems to be the case anymore.
