*I'm not the OP, this was posted by **Seanimal** on *09/28/2024* to XYZ Discord server.* 

Adobe premium customer in the US here. I've installed the latest version of Android Photoshop Express on my Samsung phone (Z Flip 4) and Samsung tablet (S9 FE+). Both devices are running OneUI 6.1.

The phone version of the app has an informative front page that leads me toward some neat AI features like Expand Images and Remove Objects. For various ergonomic reasons, I'd like to use these features on my tablet.

The tablet version does not have this front page - it only takes me to a gallery view of images on the tablet and asks me to select a photo to edit. Selecting a photo does not show me any of the AI features I'd expect to see.

When can we expect to see feature parity between different modern Android devices? Is there a roadmap somewhere that I can see?
