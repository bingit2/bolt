title: "adding sample all layers option to marquee tool"
date: 2024-11-10

*I'm not the OP, this was posted by **ðŸ¥‡ Master NorpQ ðŸ¥‡** on *10/08/2024* to XYZ Discord server.* 

if i have two layers that i want to select then copy part of both with marquee tool the only ways to do so is by  (first way : Marriage the two layers then select with the marquee tool like normal or select the part the i want from the two layer individually then marge both of them)
it would much easier if we have sample all layers option with the marquee tool like clone stamp, smudge, blur, sharpen, paint bucket, spot healing burhs and healing brush tools
