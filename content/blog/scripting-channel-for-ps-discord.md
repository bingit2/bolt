*I'm not the OP, this was posted by **riskytrizkit** on *08/27/2024* to XYZ Discord server.* 

Not sure why this doesn't exist - it's the most complicated thing in Photoshop and there are only so many places to get actual feedback on it. Lets not bottleneck that.

> We've tried to get that going but there are very few developers knowledgeable about scripting for Ps who want to participate here. Also, there really aren't a lot of users coming here to request that help. You should try posting questions to the Ps Community Forum: https://community.adobe.com/t5/photoshop-ecosystem/ct-p/ct-photoshop?page=1&amp;sort=latest_replies&amp;lang=all&amp;tabid=all&amp;topics=label-actionsandscripting

> Yeah. That's not true. If we build the channel and people post questions to it and don't get answers, what then? We have to direct them to the Ps Community Forum for help anyway. Its pointless. For the one or two scripting questions we get here every 4 months, its easier and more efficient for people to post to the Ps Comm Forum. There is also a Photoshop Developers Forum there. I suggest you try that.

> That wasn't my question. Do you have that expertise? Because if we have people who are experts in these topics and are willing to help out, I can push for it and they can consider it.

> Well it feels like this server lacks a place for developers, and... it makes me a little sad as my very intention for joining this server was to seek some help with my scripts. I wouldn't ofc expect my questions to be answered right away, but if there's even a little hope of them getting answered, isn't it worth trying out? Like what's the worst that could happen with an inactive channel around? surely, it won't bring about a catastrophe, or would it? Please correct me if wrong, it just seems unjust to developers such as myself.

> In my opinion, no one minds if you post your scripting questions in https://discord.com/channels/547473772727238676/548246314383835146. (If in doubt, just ask the moderators.) And it would be even better if you use your scripting knowledge to help with scripting questions. However, since I've been on the server, I haven't seen a single scripting question here.

> You're also free to post in the # &#128221;questions-forum which would likely be more appropriate if the question requires a dump of source code. We'd prefer you use the forum channel rather than the # &#10067;ask-a-question channel.

> I'd assume "no one minds" is just not many are ones who could answer it, and with the number of questions each day, it seems that a scripting question once asked, would just be lost within the new non scripting questions.

> If terms of their being a dedicated channel for that, it will likely require more people interested in that and then a pro who can dedicate time to answering questions in said channel if one were to be established.

**dhumann** *(09/11/2024)*  

> Thus, put it in the # &#128221;questions-forum  and it won't get lost in the # &#10067;ask-a-question chat.

> I understand. I just see a lot more engagement from experienced people answering scripting questions on the web forum. However, I will pass these questions/concerns up the chain of command. :)
